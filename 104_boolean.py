# Boolean and Comparison Operators

# Boolean - it is a data type that is either True or False (1 or 0)

print(True)
print(type(True))

print(" ")

print(False)
print(type(False))

# Comparison Operators

# comparison operators allows to evaluate a code
# they output --> a boolean

num_a = 10
num_b = 13

# asserting ig something is equal
# use double equals to equate someting
print( 10 == '10')
print(num_a == 10)
print(num_b == 10)

# Greater Than
print("Using > ")
print(num_a > 10)
print(num_b > 10)

# Smaller Than
print("Using < ")
print(num_a < 10)
print(num_b < 10)

# Greater OR Equal Than
print("Using >= ")
print(num_a >= 10)
print(num_b >= 10)

# Smaller OR Equal Than
print("Using <= ")
print(num_a <= 10)
print(num_b <= 10)

# Not Equal To...
print("Not Equal To !=  ")
print(num_a != 10)
print(num_b != 10)

# is something
print(0 is 0)
